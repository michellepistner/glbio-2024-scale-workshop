## Overview

- These slides are by no means polished.
- Idea: Use a simulation and Vandputte to introduce SRI + SSRVs + modifications to ALDEx2

## Recap: Sequencing Depth is Unrelated to Scale

## Recap: This can mislead analyses.

## Recap: ... and lead to unacknowledged bias.

## Motivating Example: Antibiotic Study

## Scale Reliant Inference: The Basics

## Scale Reliant Inference: Formal Definition

## The Updated ALDEx2 Software

## Real Example: Vandputte
