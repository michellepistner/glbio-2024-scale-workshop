##GLBIO Slide Outline

# Proposed examples: Vandputte + simulation.
  - Simulation used in Parts 1-4. Vandputte used in Part 5.
  - Vandputte data in a phyloseq object.
  - Simulated data in a phyloseq object but have the code for the simulations available.

# Part 1: Recap of Greg's talk

# Slide 1: Sequencing Depth is Not Reflective of Total
  - Toy example from SRI paper

# Slide 2: Practical Implication is that Inferences May be Wrong.
  - Highlight which taxa are actually changing.
  - Highlight which taxa are changing in TSS terms.


# Slide 3: This leads to Unacknowledged Bias.
  - Plot of FDR versus sample size for ALDEx2 and Deseq2

# Part 2: High-Level SRI
  - 

# Part 3: More-Detailed SRI

# Part 4: Changes to ALDEx2 to Make it an SRI

# Part 5: Real Data Example (Vandputte)
  - Slides to establish:

## Updates to Greg's Slides
  - Needs to be more of what he typically presents. Some people call the data as compositional. Data/normalizations
  - He needs to step away from notation.
  - Show that CoDA tools can be massively wrong.
