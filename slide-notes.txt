  + Part 1:
    + Sequence count data (same format and problems for RNA-seq, microbiome, etc...)
    + There are a number of problems with this data but the sequencing depth being arbitrary is a known driving problem
    + Many use normalizations, different normalizations give different answers,
    + In recent years people have started viewing the data as compositional
    + The data is also counts more recently people discussing as count compositional
    + From a pure CoDA perspective can't do DA or many other analyses
    + Still some methods (e.g., aldex2, locom, many others) think of the data as compositional but try to do those difficult analyses
    + Present ALDEx2 and explain the rational behind its design.
  + Part 2:
    + Start with our toy example (20 taxa) and show how there is a problem
    + Worse, problem gets worse with more data
    + Few real data examples highlighting there is a problem
    + Highlight that status quo is insufficient
    + Why not just use sparsity assumptions?
      + how sparse?
+ Michelle
  + Part 1
    + Introduce W and Y notation and estimands (LFC)
    + Apply to aldex2 model to show assumption
    + What is we just modeled potential error in the assumption?
    + Theory aside
      + A bit more formal [for those interested] -- point out how all this connects to identifiability
      + limits on inference - "holy shit this is important!"
    + Really what we have done is create an SSRV (won't define) but in [cite] we give theoretical details and prove why these models work
  + Part 2
    + discuss aldex2, how to use and examples.
